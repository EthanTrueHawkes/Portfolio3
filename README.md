# Personal portfolio

[My Notes](notes.md)

I am planning to create a personal portoflio website for displaying User Experience projects with a built in chat window that allows employers and other people to reach out to me over the website. Portfolio will also include support for locked projectes with log in requirements in order to view said locked projects, and persistent messaging between viewers and myself that will email both parties additionally.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Imagine a designer who is proficent with design systems and has technical coding experience to compliment the skill, who can also design with development limitations in mind. This is a personal portfolio that an such an individual is creating in order to showcase their expertise in the field. It is a full stack design portfolio creates from scratch, that implements browser to browser communication and persistent user information. (I promise I'm not trying to sound high and mighty, but it says elevator pitch so I have to pitch it)

### Design

![LandingPage](Assets/PortfolioLandingPage.png)

The first fold of landing page will display my name, and a short ad lib about me, messages, and navigation. It will also contain my top 3 interests in the field of both UX Design & Computer Science. When one of these interests is hovered a visual design corresponding to the item will appear to the right of the item.

The project view will display the visual of the project with a short description, then jump into scope, role, and timeline.
Afterwards the content for the case study will follow and have a persistent UI showcasing where in the process the user currently is.
